                          <p><i>Many people on the autism spectrum experience anxieties, which can have a big impact on their daily lives. In collaboration with design agency Panton, child and youth psychiatric centre Karakter and the University of Twente, this project aimed to engage in participatory design in order to conceptualise, prototype and evaluate a new assistive technology that may support young autistic adults with anxiety disorders to develop independence in daily living. Design decisions were derived from an in-depth co-design process featuring multiple sessions with an autistic individual, healthcare professionals and design experts.</i></p><p><i>The resulting product 'Unfold' specifically targets young adults with agoraphobia to help them develop more independence in part by previewing unknown spaces through a connected device. By facilitating a more accessible way of exploring new places, Unfold motivates users to expand the area that they feel comfortable in. Unfold was featured at the <a href="https://ddw.nl/">Dutch Design Week</a> 2019.</i></p>

The assignment was aimed to improve the Electronic Parking License (EPL), an in-vehicle device that ensures availability of parking bays for designated audiences, as part of Nedap’s vehicle detection and parking solutions platform SENSIT. As a result, design recommendations for the EPL were proposed and a new prototype was presented.</i></p>
