                          <p><i>At MetaChef, we changed the way people think about education and marketing.</i></p>
                          <p><i>Starting in the sector we know best, the food industry, we developed engaging 3D solutions for fun (VR) learning experiences, interactive sales presentations, and smarter online marketing material.</i></p>
                          <p><i>Within just two years, we established the world's largest database of 3D food and packaging, making it accessible to customers via our own innovative online platform.</i></p>
                          <p><i>As a UX Designer, I was responsible for the platform's design and system architecture. I worked closely with clients to understand their needs and collaborated with our talented software developers to create an accessible and efficient platform.</i></p>

                          <h6>MSc Intern in Industrial Design</h6>
                          <p><i>I started project 'Unfold' in collaboration with design agency Panton, psychiatric centre Karakter, and the University of Twente. Our goal was to help young autistic adults with anxiety gain more independence. By working closely with autistic individuals, healthcare professionals, and design experts, we ensured 'Unfold' resonated well with its intended users. The ideas from autistic individuals themselves made a big difference, making it easy for them to connect with our project.</i></p>
                          <p><i>'Unfold' is a product for young adults with agoraphobia that shows them new places before they visit, using a connected device. This makes the thought of going to new places less scary and encourages them to get out more. Participating in the <a href="https://ddw.nl/">Dutch Design Week</a> 2019, 'Unfold' highlighted the importance of inclusive design.</i></p>

Inspired by the vision of smarter, more welcoming cities, my goal was to make the EPL both more convenient to use and aesthetically pleasing. This journey was a perfect blend of my design passion and the aspiration to contribute to meaningful urban mobility solutions.</i></p>
